It is a part of the natural phenomenon which maintains the equilibrium in the atmosphere.\n- But conditions can be worse sometimes. When the atmospheric conditions are extreme or intense enough to cause property loss or life loss, such weather is termed as severe weather.\n- These also vary according to the altitudes, latitudes, and region and pressure differences. Tornadoes, cyclones, heavy rainfall, fog, winter storms come under this category. They are disastrous and hazardous. Proper [disaster management](https://byjus.com/physics/safety-measures-technology/) and strategies are required to handle these conditions\n\n--- \n**<p> Elements of Weather: </p>**\n1.
